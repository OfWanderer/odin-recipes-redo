    <h2>Simple yet Tasty</h2>
        <p>As far as potatoes go in general they are not the most fabulous, outstanding or exotic type of vegetable yet they are in the role of a main actor for this specific salad.</p>
        <p>Just like in most of the movies or tv shows as there is a main character there are also supporting characters to the story, in our case that would be other type of vegetables that we will include within this salad.</p>
        <p>Even though I will share with you some ingredients that you can use feel free to make your own adjustments and make use of different kind of vegetables that you think it can compliment our salad and it's main character, The Potato!</p>
