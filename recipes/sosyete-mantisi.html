        <h4>Preparation of The Topping</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><pre>Smash the amount of garlic you want in your yogurt. <em>(2-3 Cloves of Garlic Recommended)</em></pre></li>
            <li><pre>Put the amount of yogurt you would like to have into a cup and then mix it with the smashed garlic.</pre></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Preparation of The Sauce <em>(It is recommended to prepare the sauce after you finish the main dish)</em></h4>
        <ol>
            <li><pre>Put 2 tablespoons of butter into a container or a pan that you can cook.</pre></li>
            <li><pre>Heat up the butter until it starts melting and add mint, red pepper flakes into it.</pre></li>
            <li><pre>Cook it until the butter takes a brown color, try to avoid cooking it for too much and there it is.Your sauce that will go on top of the yogurt mix should be ready.</pre></li>
        </ol>
        
            <h4>Main Dish</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><pre>First of all we need to prepare the filling for our patty.</pre></li>
            <li><pre>Dice the onion into thin small pieces and then cook it on a pan with sunflower oil until it gets pinky.</pre></li>
            <li><pre>Then add the minced meat on top of it and continue to cook.</pre></li>
            <li><pre>When the color of the mix has changed and the meat has been relatively cooked add the tomato paste, a bit of salt and other spices. </pre></li>
            <li><pre>After it is cooked turn off the heat, add a sprinkle of chopped parsley and start mixing it. </pre></li>
            <li><pre>Cut the phyllo doughs into equal 4 pieces. </pre></li>
            <li><pre>After that apply a mixture of water and oil onto every each piece of phyllo dough with the help of a pastry brush and then place the fillings on afterwards.</pre></li>
            <li><pre>Then you can roll the phyllo dough like a tube and give it shape of a rose.You can see how it is done within the video link above. </pre></li>
            <li><pre>Again you apply the mixture of water and oil onto the rolled phyllo doughs with the help of a brush and then you put into oven which should be at 170°C without fans for about 20 minutes. </pre></li>
            <li><pre>Without burning the top of them they should cook nicely until they get slightly pink and then taken out of the oven.</pre></li>
            <li><pre>Put the amount of pieces or a piece that you would like to eat onto a platter and pour the mixture of yogurt and garlic on top. </pre></li>
            <li><pre>And lastly you pour down the amount of sauce you want on top.</pre></li>
