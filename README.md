Redo of a previous project that was completed.
Basic HTML knowledge is to be practiced upon and will be revisited in the future for further CSS applications.
Everything that are being used within this redo is taken from the previously completed project and serves as a repeat of former practice to reinforce current knowledge on HTML and other languages.
